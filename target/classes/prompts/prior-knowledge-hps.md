# Case Study: Hotel Pricing System (HPS)

## Design Purpose
This project can be considered greenfield development, as it involves the complete replacement of an existing system. The purpose of the design activity is to make initial decisions to support the construction of the system from scratch.

## Primary Functionality

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| HPS-1: Log In | A user (commercial or administrator) provides their credentials in a login window. The system checks these credentials against a user identity service and, if successful, provides access to the system. Once logged in, a user can only make queries and changes to the hotels for which they have been authorized. |
| HPS-2: Change Prices | A user selects a specific hotel for which they are authorized to change prices, and selects dates where they want to make price changes to either a base rate or a fixed rate. All of the prices for the rates that are calculated from the base rate are calculated at that point. The system allows price changes to be simulated before they are actually changed. When the prices are changed, they are pushed to the Channel Management System and become available for querying by external systems. |
| HPS-3: Query Prices | A user or an external system queries prices for a given hotel through the user interface or a query API. |
| HPS-4: Manage Hotels | An administrator adds, changes, or modifies hotel information. This includes editing the hotel's tax rates, available rates, and room types. |
| HPS-5: Manage Rates | An administrator adds, changes, or modifies rates. This includes defining the calculation business rules for the different rates. |
| HPS-6: Manage Users | An administrator changes permissions for a given user. |

## Quality Attributes

| ID | Quality Attribute | Scenario | Associated Use Case | Importance to Customer | Difficulty of Implementation |
|----|------------------|----------|--------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------|
| QA-1 | Performance | A base rate price is changed for a specific hotel and date during normal operation; the prices for all the rates and room types for the hotel are published (ready for query) in less than 100 ms. | HPS-2 | High | High |
| QA-2 | Reliability | A user performs multiple price changes on a given hotel; 100% of the price changes are published (available for query) successfully and are also received by the Channel Management System. | HPS-2 | High | High |
| QA-3 | Availability | Pricing queries uptime SLA must be 99.9% outside of maintenance windows. | All | High | High |
| QA-4 | Scalability | The system will initially support a minimum of 100,000 price queries per day through its API and should be capable of handling up to 1,000,000 without decreasing average latency by more than 20%. | HPS-3 | High | High |
| QA-5 | Security | A user logs into the system through the front-end. The credentials of the user are validated against the User Identity Service and, once logged in, they are presented with only the functions that they are authorized to use. | All | High | Medium |
| QA-6 | Modifiability | Support for a price query endpoint with a different protocol than REST (e.g., gRPC) is added to the system. The new endpoint does not require changes to be made to the core components of the system. | All | Medium | Medium |
| QA-7 | Deployability | The application is moved between nonproduction environments as part of the development process. No changes in the code are needed. | All | Medium | Medium |
| QA-8 | Monitorability | A system operator wishes to measure the performance and reliability of price publication during operation. The system provides a mechanism that allows 100% of these measures to be collected as needed. | HPS-2 | Medium | Medium |
| QA-9 | Testability | 100% of the system and its elements should support integration testing independently of the external systems. | All | Medium | Medium |

## Architectural Concerns

| ID | Concern |
|----|---------|
| CRN-1 | Establish an overall initial system structure. |
| CRN-2 | Leverage the team's knowledge about Java technologies, the Angular framework, and Kafka. |
| CRN-3 | Allocate work to members of the development team. |
| CRN-4 | Avoid introducing technical debt. |
| CRN-5 | Set up a continuous deployment infrastructure. |

## Constraints

| ID | Constraint |
|----|-----------|
| CON-1 | Users must interact with the system through a web browser in different platforms (Windows, OSX, and Linux, and different devices). |
| CON-2 | Manage users through cloud provider identity service and host resources in the cloud. |
| CON-3 | Code must be hosted on a proprietary Git-based platform that is already in use by other projects in the company. |
| CON-4 | The initial release of the system must be delivered in 6 months, but an initial version of the system (MVP) must be demonstrated to internal stakeholders in at most 2 months. |
| CON-5 | The system must interact initially with existing systems through REST APIs but may need to later support other protocols. |
| CON-6 | A cloud-native approach should be favored when designing the system. |
